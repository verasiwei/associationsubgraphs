    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl><dt>association_pairs</dt>
<dd><p>dataframe with columns <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> representing the
ids of the variables or nodes and columns <code>strength</code> that is a numeric
indicator of strength of association (higher = stronger).</p></dd>
<dt>node_info</dt>
<dd><p>Optional dataframe that has a column <code>id</code> that corresponds
to the variables codded in <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> of <code>association_pairs</code> that contains
additional info nade available on hover in visualization.</p></dd>
<dt>measure_title</dt>
<dd><p>Name of measure used to quantify strength of association
between the variables.</p></dd>
<dt>alphaDecay</dt>
<dd><p>Paramter to control how fast the force-layout converges.
Lower values mean a better but slower layout, higher means faster. See the
<a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-force#simulation_alphaDecay" class="external-link">d3-force docs</a> for
more info.</p></dd>
<dt>n_neighbors</dt>
<dd><p>How many neighbors for a hovered node should be shown?</p></dd>
<dt>warn_of_mismatches</dt>
<dd><p>If there are differences in the ids present in
<code>association_pairs</code> and <code>node_info</code> should a warning be issued?</p></dd>
</dl></div>
    <div id="value">
    <h2>Value</h2>
    <p>Interactive javascript visualization of association network</p>
    </div>
    <div id="details">
    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>The plot automatically detects isolated subgraphs (groups of nodes with
connections only within the group) and lays them out in a grid to avoid
overlap between unrelated parts of the network.</p>
